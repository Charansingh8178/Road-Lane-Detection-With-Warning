# Road-Lane-Detection-With-Warning


This is a simple Road Lane Detection System where it takes input as your video format
then after it it preprocesses it and then shows a defined Trapezoid type figure which marks
the area between two lanes. 
There is also a warning system which works on threshold if the car crosses the line it warns the user.
